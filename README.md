# from_notebook
Small Python utility for importing functions, classes, and constants from .ipynb files.

Allows definitions from one notebook to be used in Python files or other notebooks.

Only functions, classes, `SNAKE_CAPS` constants, and imported modules can be imported. No other notebook code is executed.
